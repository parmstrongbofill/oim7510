    # Mini Project 1

    Your choice of option, what each one asks for, the due date and how it is graded are on the Mini Project 1 page of the course site, linked from the calendar. This notebook is the shape to build it in. Keep the headings, and replace each line in italics with your own.

    Save it in your course repository as `projects/mp1/<your-tool>.py`, named for what it does, such as `loan-schedule.py`, and open it with `uv run marimo edit`.

    ## 1. The Question

    The team behind Nota al Margen, a Spanish-language book podcast, would use this tool. It helps them decide whether investing in Spotify advertising is worth it, by comparing how many months it takes to reach a download goal with organic growth versus with paid promotion, and how much that promotion would cost in total.

    ## 2. My Plan Before AI

    *Before you ask your agent anything, write how you would solve it: the steps, in order, in plain words, in five lines or more.
    1. I start with the current monthly downloads (the real number from September).
    2. For the organic scenario, each month I multiply the previous month's downloads by (1 + the organic growth rate), until it reaches the goal.
    3. For the paid scenario, I do the same but with the paid growth rate, and I also add up the monthly promotion cost.
    4. I repeat month by month until each scenario reaches the goal, counting how many months each one took.
    5. At the end, I compare how many months the paid promotion saves, and how much it cost in total.
    6. (Note) This assumes a constant growth rate, which is a simplification — in reality, many variables could affect real growth, and a true A/B test would be more accurate.

    *What does your loop carry from one step to the next, the way a running total carries its sum?*
    -  The number of downloads accumulated so far each month (and, in the paid scenario, also the accumulated cost).

    *Which check will you use in section 6, and which two numbers should agree?*
    - If I set the growth rate to 0%, each month's downloads should stay exactly equal to the previous month's, never growing.

    *Commit this notebook with the message `mp1: plan before AI`.*

    Every number the project starts from goes in the cell below, and nowhere else, so that changing one input changes every result after it.

    Copy in the default inputs for your option from the Mini Project 1 page. If you chose D, your own option, type your data in here, or ask your agent to generate it with `faker`. The required part reads no file.
